# Me

I am a software engineer with 30+ years experience, mostly in C/C++ - across virtually all platforms including embedded.
I also have 10+ years experience in JavaScript (mostly NodeJS) and Java (mostly Android) and some Kotlin (Android.)
I have done about 3 years of Go.
I have been using Python since the 1990s, but only as "a better bash" for system scripting.
I have played around with Zig some, and really would like to do more.
I have a little lua scripting - mostly scripting Redis.

Of all those, my favorite is Go - I am always looking for a project that is suited to Golang.
Of course, 30 years of C/C++, and I am most effective in it.
I know how to write C/C++ without falling into the dangerous traps. Plus, good tools go a long way here.

I prefer the JetBrains IDEs, but VS-code is very good, and I am a lifelong team-vim.

Linux is a much better development OS, but there is lots of work on Windows.
I have several years experience with AWS, the AWS CLI and the JS API for AWS.

I have 15+ years developing network apps, mostly at the socket level.
