# Terms that Claude Understands

## Games

- "Walking Skeleton" - you build a complete but basic system first, then enhance it over time.

## Non-Game Software

- "Discriminated Unions" - in type systems, where certain properties/values determine what other properties are valid.
- "Tagged Unions" - same as Discriminated Unions.

## Non-Coding

- "Sensible Defaults" - having good starting values that work reasonably well.
- "Progressive Enhancement" - starting with a basic system that works, then improving specific cases
