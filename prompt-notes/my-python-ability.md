# My Experience with Python

I have worked with Python since the 1990s, but not much beyond just scripting - using Python as a better bash.
Avoided anything but the standard library.
Have always hated the whole virtual environment thing - but I realize it is usually a necessary evil.

If a venv is needed (it almost always is), say what needs to be added - like a requirements.txt.
I prefer uv.

I need a lot of hand-holding with:
- full-featured Python apps (coding them) - the whole setup.py thing and python modules and all that.
- Delivering any of my Python work to others - who never have their system setup to run anything but vanilla Python.
